            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello there! I am Khoa, an aspiring game developer that has also dipped my toes in some other areas of
                programming with at least something to show. I am rather <abbr
                    title="with an IELTS 8.0 to back it up">proficient in English</abbr>, to
                the point where I would say more so than my Vietnamese. Having graduated with a Bachelor degree in
                Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology in late 2023 with only a couple of months
                of experience working professionally, I am hungry to expand my knowledge and look to constantly
                challenge myself mentally through coding <s>to question my perception of realities and perhaps my very
                    own existence, also I would love to be generating income too :D</s>.

                <h3>YATK</h3>
                <p>This is a bullet hell game very much inspired by Touhou, perhaps a bit too much. It is built with
                    Unity and is in my honest opinion the game that I have put the most effort into out of all the games
                    I have made.</p>

                <p>The old link has been moved here. This was my second attempt ever at making a game, one that is so
                    primitive that it tries to replicate what I did for my first game, which revolves around very
                    primitive graphics and shapes. Made with pure HTML, JS and CSS for good measures, this is a bullet
                    hell game where you dodge things that are shot at you and try to survive.</p>

                <p>You may think that my projects are heavily game-skewed, and you would be right, but throughout the
                    years I have also worked on many other fields of programming, namely web programming with PHP.
                    Briefly going over them, I have an amateur pure PHP app I made while studying, a full-blown Laravel
                    group capstone project with third party service integration and hosting, and my latest Laravel VueJS
                    app that I made to learn more about GraphQL and VueJS in my free time, not so aptly named example0,
                    because I lack creativity. While it probably does not
                    amount to much, I hope that it at least shows that I am not just a game nerd.</p>

                    while the
                    frontend is located <a href="https://github.com/Raverbury/example0_frontend">here</a>.</p>

                <p>
                    Outside of all of those, I am proficient in Python, or at least proficient enough to make a working
                    desktop application using the ever popular Qt GUI library. Its purpose is to play audio, with a
                    twist of being capable of looping around user-defined loop points to achieve what is referred to as
                    seamless looping, often seen in game soundtracks. Or you can make jokey loops too if you want, like
                    "X but it never starts". Also 3 because this is my 3rd execution of this idea.

            <p>Disclaimer: Plenty of the projects I have on GitHub are finished works, it is just that I do not have
                a
                habit of releasing builds for most projects, even more so for the niche/personal use ones. For those
                without a release, you will likely need to build or set them up yourself, instructions are probably
                included
                in the READMEs, if not then that is 3417% on me and I deserve to be crucified.</p>
